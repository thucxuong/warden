# Changelog

## 0.2.1 — 2026-10-18

- Allow `warden done` from main checkout when the worktree is removed after merging.
- Skip gate proof check when the worktree is gone at ship time.
- Track token usage (input, output, cache read/write) from the reviewer.
- Fix `warden report --status --write` to append missing report rows.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-10-18

- Install via marketplace (option A, option B with team settings.json).
- `/warden:init` onboarding: scan stack, draft context, steps, checks, setup script.
- `/warden:compose` and three templates (do, feature, bugfix) with flow linter.
- Engine loop: `warden start`, `next`, `done`, `wait` with output validation and git evidence.
- Check gate: runs check commands from steps.json, captures logs.
- Triage: clean-copy run on the base commit, branch reruns for flake detection, error signatures, and rule matching.
- Fixer handoff: inserted fix step, `warden:fixer` subagent, scope rules, fix notes and triage rules, routing by verdict.
- Review gate: `claude -p` read-only, JSON findings, out-of-diff findings dropped, up to 3 rounds, leftovers in PR description.
- Approve step: human types `approve` or `reject`, skipped when the session runs with `PROJECT_AGENT=1`.
- Ship step: proof tied to the commit the gates ran on, history written into the branch.
- Hooks: SessionStart status, PreToolUse blocking, Stop blocking, UserPromptSubmit approvals, session records.
- Live state in main checkout via `git rev-parse --git-common-dir`.
- `warden reset`, `warden retry` (human), resume after crash, `/warden:status`.
- Site: local Bun server with task timeline, tokens, findings, verdicts as plain text.
- `/warden:report` (outbox one machine only), `/warden:retro` (session start offers every 2 days), `/warden:upgrade` with notes.
- Tool registry with `git-pr` tool: `warden tools list`, `warden tools add`.

## 0.1.1 — 2026-10-18

- Init sets lastRetro to today so retro is not immediately due after setup.
- Add `warden report set` command to update report status and metadata with validation.
- Add retry hint to blocked status message to guide users on how to continue.
- Retro skill now requires explicit user confirmation before running.
- Improve retro-due messaging in session start to guide CPA behavior.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-10-18

- Doorbell: `warden report` wakes the Warden Agent on the same machine, which triages the report in a headless run. The CPA sees only `sent`.
- `warden report --status` lists this project's reports with status, fixed-in version and note.
- Periodic checks: `.warden/checks/<name>.md`, `warden checks`, `checks run`, `checks done`. Command checks can run in the background at session start (`auto: true`).
- The retro is now the built-in agent check `retro`; `warden retro --done` stays as an alias. `lastRetro` in `warden.json` is legacy.
- Session start says when a newer version is in the local marketplace clone (no network).
- Run `/warden:upgrade` to move `lastRetro` into `.warden/checks/retro.md`.
